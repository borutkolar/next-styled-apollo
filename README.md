# Next.js with Apollo Client Authentication and Styled-Components

This is a boilerplate to get up and running with:
* Next.js
* Apollo Client - GraphQL
* Styled-Components

It was made out of the simple annoyance of having to set it up for every side project I start. Hope you enjoy it and wish to add to it. 

### Get Started

`git clone https://github.com/Caryyon/next-styled-apollo.git`

`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

### Future

Might make it a `npm init` generator, but at this point I don't need more than this.
